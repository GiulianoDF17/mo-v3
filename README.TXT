Project: music-organizer-v3. A project to collect audio files.
Authors: David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

This project is part of the material for the book

   Objects First with Java - A Practical Introduction using BlueJ
   Seventh edition
   David J. Barnes and Michael Kölling

It is discussed in chapter 4.

To start:

Create a MusicOrganizer object on the object bench.
Use its methods to add, remove, and play files. The listAllFiles
method prints a list of the collection.

25. If there was no matching file then what would've happened was that nothing was printed since the print value is (filename).
28. for(Track track : trackList){
    
}
